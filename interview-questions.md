# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX helps JavaScript translate into HTML. The differences between the two is that JSX uses camelCases to call upon components from javascript.

Researched answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML or Javascript Syntax Extension and it makes it easier to write react applications. As it is a markdown syntax extension to javascript. Also, it behaves very similarly to HTML which a couple of differences. Uses syntatical sugar for react, which makes pieces of code "sweeter". In addition, two syntax difference between JSX and HTML is that JSX has reserved keywords for class and for unlike HTML. So to define class names and for attributes use camelCasing; className and HTMLFor.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager that allows people to share code with each other. The node Modules are modified when the command yarn is ran within the terminal.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager that manages all dependancy files. Which leads to to package manager will install dependencies, manage the dependencies, and supply us terminal commands to execute tests. The file that is modified is the package.json file, and installs node modules with their dependencies. 

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A react component is a function that is written in javascript that can be passed to JSX land in between the react fragments.

Researched answer: A React Component is a specific type of function that can contain JavaScript logic and returns a markup for the browser to render. In addition, they are independent and reusable bits of code and returns to HTML. It can be either state or stateless, which refers to it can be either a logic component (holds state) or display component (stateless).

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: The difference between state values and props is that state values has two parameters and is a react hook. One that holds the data, and one that changes the data. Props on the other hand, refer to the state values and can be called upon with curly braces within any file.

Researched answer: A state value is a special variable that stores data that determines how components renders and behaves. By using the React Hook which is a built-in method, the React Hook useState() can define the variable with an inital value and provide methods to change that value. In contrast, props is short for properties, and is the communication between reusable components in react i.e React Hooks. It passes data from one component down to a nested component, and the data is usually comes from a value of a State. In comparison, a state value holds information and a prop calls upon it and passes it down to components tasked to deal with user interaction of that information from state.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Domestic Object Model, and it is the visual respresentation of the website. DOM can range from visual to events.

Researched answer: DOM is a visual representation of code. When looking at a website in the browser you are looking at a DOM. When there is changes from the user or broswer i.e clicks, typing, etc. these are DOM events, and only updating that particular instance or element.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: A div tag can house a lot of content within it, and a span tag is usually for a header or title.

Researched answer: The span tag is used on an inline element, and a div tag is used for a block element. You can have a span within a div. An inline level element does not form new blocks of content. In contrast, a block element is formatted visually as blocks i.e paragraphs.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Is referred to OOP, it was created to help developers deal with complexity and size of software systems. Instead of one big blob of dependencies, section off areas that perform code procedures so the program can interact on small parts instead of the one big blob.

2. Ruby: Is an open source OOP that has simplicity both for writing and reading code. It is a general-purpose, dynamically-typed, server-side scripting language. Has many built in methods for practical use.

3. Implicit return: Unlike Javascripts; every function needs a return. In contrast, ruby has an implicit return which if there is no return specified the last value of the last line of the block of code is automatically returned.

4. Ruby blocks: Is an anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome, and is defined with do and end. Very different from Javascript syntax, looks more simple. 

5. Ruby hashes: A hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. It is different from an array/object. Instead of the values being an index, it is referenced by their unique key. Also falls under enumerable which means you can use iterable methods on a hash.
